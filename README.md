We have developed our own computer game for the Computer Games & Visual Effects-Course!
There is only one specification given, the keyword for the primary game mechanic is "Attraction".

Our game will be a metroidvania, a 2D-Jump'n'Run/Sidescroller. As the player you will discover an
interconnected map of several areas. To reach the next area you first have to find special items
or skills. 

All items, skills and weapons are centered around the keyword "Attraction". Furthermore we interpret
"Attraction" as a physical term and will be used as a synonym for gravity.
